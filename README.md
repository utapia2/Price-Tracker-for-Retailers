# Price-Tracker-for-Retailers

First project I am hosting on github.
It is a website price tracker! So far it tracks any walmart page, will add fucntionality for Best Buy and Target
It asks for a website item page, it lists the current price and then asks you what price you wish it would be.
It emails you once the item is at or below the set price
Checks every n hours set by user.
